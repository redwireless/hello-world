# hello-world
// Getting acquainted with GitHub... 
// r√©d wireless is a collective of Sr. RF/wireless Engineers dedicated in helping the 'middleprise', businesses, entities and individuals
// with wireless connectivity problems, solutions, theory, practice and technologies. Coding has been a very distant 'sub-set' of what
// we do, with mostly VBA for Excel old experience. Understanding that code is present everywhere, we finally 'jumped' on the GitHub
// train to further expand our more than 20+ years of wireless experience with what makes it all 'tick' inside : code. :) Wish us luck!
